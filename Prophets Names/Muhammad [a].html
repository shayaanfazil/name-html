<p><h5>Muhammad [a] is considered the last prophet in Islam. He was born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in the year 570 CE. He is known for his religious, social, and political leadership and is considered the founder of Islam. The Arabic phrase “sallallahu alayhi wa sallam” means “May Allah honor him and grant him peace” or “peace and blessings of Allah be upon him” and should be used specifically when saying Prophet Muhammad’s name. It is a prayer that Muslims say after they mention the Prophet Muhammad’s name and is a sign of love and respect for him </h5></p>
